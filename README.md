# Building a Curriculum for VWC
Keep in mind that laying out a well thought-out and comprehensive curriculum that achieves our organizational goals is an iterative process. We seek to continually improve the effectiveness of our courses by improving learning outcomes. 

Primary focus at the beginning is on writing learning objectives and an overall content structure to support those objectives. 

## 1. Overall Objective
This describes the intended outcome of the course from the learners perspective. 

*Ex. By completing this course the learner will have all the essential skills to be hired as a Frontend Developer.*

TODO - Provide a guide for how to write a solid overall objective. 

## 2. Course Prerequisites
What prior knowledge and skills should the learner have before taking this course. You may not be able to effectively determine this until you've completed the course design and development process. 

## 3. Curriculum Structure
Repository will be named after the course *ex web-development-curriculum*
Folder for each top level module. 

Includes a readme for that includes:
- **Rationale** - Explain why learners should learn this and how it applies to them and the overall goal. 
- **Objectives** - Inform the learner what they will be able to do when they complete the learning module. 
- **Evaluation** - Explains how the module will be evaluated. 
- **Resources** - Provides resources for completing activities. 
- **Activities** - Gives the learners things to do. 

- **Next Step** - Describe what to do next. 

Include a folder for each lesson within the module that will include that specific lessons activities and resources. 

TODO Include a sample file structure for people to use as a template.


## 4. How to Write an Effective Rationale
If a learner knows why they should learn something and values it, they are much more likely to actually learn it. 

This also provides us an opportunity when designing a course to make sure we are only including lessons where we've evaluated the trade-offs and decided the lessons will be valued by the learners. 

## 5. How to Write Performance Objectives
A performance objective tells the learners what they will be able to do by the end of a lesson. 
TODO - Provide a detailed description of how to write objectives with detailed examples. 

## 6. How to Build Learning Activities
Our goal is to create learning activities that lead to attaining the learning objectives. This means we create or select only activities that lead the learner directly to meeting each objective. 
TODO - Provide a detailed learning activity to accompany the example performance objectives from the previous section. 

## 7. How to Evaluate the Learners Performance
TODO - Provide a detailed example that shows how the outcomes from the activities will be used to evaluate how well a learner meets the overall performance objectives

## 8. How to Provide Feedback on Performance.
TODO - This section should provide instructors/mentors with a good reference on how to tie the learners performance back to the performance objective by providing either corrective or confirming feedback. 

## Planning the Course Schedule
This should be done once everything else is done and laid out so that we can determine the best path based on the overall object and individual learning objectives. 

This layouts out the path the course will take and should be laid out in weekly increments. 

* Ex. Week 1, Day 1 - How the Internet Works
