# Building a Course for VWC
Keep in mind that laying out a well thought-out and comprehensive course that achieves our organizational goals is an iterative process. We seek to continually improve the effectiveness of our courses by improving learning outcomes. 

Primary focus at the beginning is on writing learning objectives and an overall content structure to support those objectives. 

## Course Structure

### :factory: Folder Structure :factory:
Repository is named after the course *ex: web-development-course*

Include a folder for each lesson within the module that will include that specific lessons activities and resources. 

Note: If you would like a specific folder order on Github displayed use a numbered prefix. As a rule of thumb start with a leading `0` example: `01`, `02`, `03` etc... this way folders will display top to bottom.

> :warning: TODO: Include a sample file structure for people to use as a template.

### Root level READMEs
Includes a root level readme that includes:

#### Rationale
Explain why learners should learn this and how it applies to them and the overall goal of the course.

If a learner knows why they should learn something and values it, they are much more likely to actually learn it. 

This also provides us an opportunity when designing a course to make sure we are only including lessons where we've evaluated the trade-offs and decided the lessons will be valued by the learners. 


#### Objectives
Inform the learner what they will be able to do when they complete the learning module. 

A performance objective tells the learners what they will be able to do by the end of a lesson. 

This describes the intended outcome of the course from the learners perspective. 

*Ex. By completing this course the learner will have all the essential skills to be hired as a Frontend Developer.*

> :warning: TODO: Provide a guide for how to write a solid overall objective. 

> :warning: TODO: Provide a detailed description of how to write objectives with detailed examples. 

#### Prerequisites
What other courses or skills do students need to complete the course.

What prior knowledge and skills should the learner have before taking this course. You may not be able to effectively determine this until you've completed the course design and development process. 

#### Syllabus
A general table of contents listing high level section headings. Generally no deeper than 2 indents.

#### Next Step
Describe what to do next. 

## Build Learning Activities
Our goal is to create learning activities that lead to attaining the learning objectives. This means we create or select only activities that lead the learner directly to meeting each objective. 

> :warning: TODO: Provide a detailed learning activity to accompany the example performance objectives from the previous section. 

## Evaluate the Learners Performance
> :warning: TODO: Provide a detailed example that shows how the outcomes from the activities will be used to evaluate how well a learner meets the overall performance objectives

## Provide Feedback on Performance.
> :warning: TODO: This section should provide instructors/mentors with a good reference on how to tie the learners performance back to the performance objective by providing either corrective or confirming feedback.
