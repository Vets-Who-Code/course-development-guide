# Sandwich Artisan Curriculum

Students in high school and college could use some extra money but can't do a full-time job. This course trains students to become sandwich artisans preparing them for jobs in the competitive market of fast food sandwich preparation. Fast food sandwich preparation is the premier part-time job because of several reasons:
1. The job market is growing. Big companies like Quiznos, Subway, and the growth of local first mom and pop shops is only rising. College campuses are a hot bed of sandwich bacchanalia. 
1. Most fast food kitchens are usually hot. Most sandwich shops are well air conditioned.
1. Drive-thru ordering is impersonal and has a higher chance of terrible customers. Sandwich shops usually don't have bad customers.
1. Preparation of sandwiches is done right in front of customer so there is little ambiguity as to whether you made their order correctly or not leading to happier customers. 
1. You get to eat free sandwiches
